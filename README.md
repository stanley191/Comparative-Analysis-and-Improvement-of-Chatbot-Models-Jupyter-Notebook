# Comparative Analysis and Improvement of Chatbot Models

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook documenting the development, evaluation, and improvement of two chatbot models: a **Bag-of-Words (BoW) classifier** and a more advanced **Transformer-based model**. The project demonstrates the end-to-end workflow of building, benchmarking, and iteratively improving conversational AI systems.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to explore and compare different approaches to intent classification and response generation in chatbots:

1. **Bag-of-Words Model** – A simple model using frequency-based text representation.
2. **Transformer Model** – A more sophisticated architecture leveraging contextual embeddings.

Key aspects of this work include:
- Designing benchmark tests to fairly compare models.
- Evaluating intent classification accuracy, confidence, and response relevance.
- Visualizing comparative results with clear metrics.
- Iteratively improving the Transformer model to close the performance gap.

---

## 🔑 Key Features
- **Intent Recognition**: Both models were trained on a curated intents dataset.
- **Benchmarking Framework**: Identical prompts were used to assess model performance.
- **Quantitative Metrics**: Accuracy, confidence scores, relevance ratings, and response times.
- **Visual Analysis**: Tables and plots for side-by-side comparisons.
- **Error Analysis & Improvements**: Identifying failure cases and refining the Transformer model.

---

## 📊 Results Summary
- The **Bag-of-Words model** achieved strong baseline accuracy with near-perfect classification on most prompts.
- The **Transformer model** initially underperformed but showed promise in capturing semantic nuances.
- Iterative improvements narrowed the performance gap, showcasing how modern NLP architectures can be optimized.
